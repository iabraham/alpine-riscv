# Subroutines in RISC-V

TASK -- Built a generic simple calculator in RISC-V assembly. 

Allowed usage: Only libc via `call`


Explain: 

 1. Difference between `ecall` and `call`
 1. Explain stack layout, frame pointers, calling convention in RISC-V 
 1. Introduce `ret`, `sp`, `jal`

TODO:

 1. Make calculator specs/requirements for students to do -- similar to MP2.
