# WASD Exercise 

In this exercise, the objective is to print to console an asterisk that can be
moved by the user using the `w`,`a`,`s`,`d` keys which quits when the user
presses `q`. 

See the gold file in action by running `./run_gold.sh`.

The `_clear` and `_exit` functions are provided for you. You will need to write
the `_poll_user` and `_print_star` subroutines along with any necessary logic
or additional subroutines.
