# Introduction to RISC-V 

In the tradition of programmers everywhere, we will stared by printing out
"Hello World!\n" to the console. Now we accept keyboard input and echo 
it back to the user.  



TODO: 

 1. Re-explain `read/write` and standard file handlers. 
 1. Compile and explain the much larger `as-echo.s` file. 
 1. Ask them to write **C program** using `read/write` to echo string back to
    user (similar to provided assembly file). Name source files appropriately
    in line with given Makefile.
 1. Ask them to write **assembly** subroutine to calculate length of string
    rather than count by hand in `as-echo`. Call new echoing assembly file as
    `as-echo-autolen`. 
 1. Ask them to extend Makefile to compile `as-echo-autolen`.
